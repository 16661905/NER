NAME ENTITY RECOGNITION 
-----------------------

This software implements several experiments by using the following toolkits

-Stanford Linear Classifier
-Stanford NER
-SVMLight, tree-kernels
-Label propagation algorithm  JUNTO

In addition it access external ressources, namely a database with the wikipedia pages until Feb 2014

We also implemented a weakly supervised algorithm that is first initialized with the weights given by the stanford linear classifier.

The following packages and classes interface with these utilities
Package:
-src/linearclassifier
	AnalyzeClassifier.java : -interfaces with Stanford Linear Classifier 
 				 -implements a weakly supervised algorithm based on risk minimisation.
					It can use the closed form for the risk estimation or a numerical approximation to the risk.
					You can set a flag for using wikipedia as an extrafeature.
					If entity found in wikipedia as person, place,organization or product. (it can take up to 2h)
        Margin.java, store stanford linear classifier weights, features, and instances.

        NumericalIntegration.java, implements the numerical  approximation to the risk
-src/gmm : All classes for the gmm-training

-src/CRFClassifier
	AnalyzeCRFClassifier.java, interfaces with stanford NER
					You can use gazetters, by using file  gazettes/gazette.txt or gazettelcase.txt (all in lowercase)
	Margin.java, class that stores the weights, features and instances of the CRF classifier
        AnalyzeSemiCRF.java, intefaces with a semi-crf implementation

-src/svm
       AnalyzeSVMClassifier.java, interfaces to SVMLight, prepares the input and evaluates the output.
			There are several input files, it generates dependency trees for using tree kernel, polynomial kerner or linear kernel, it can even use
			the same features as the Stanford linear classifier.

-src/lex , necessary classes for storing utterances, words, lexical unix, postags and dependency trees


-src/resources
       WikipediaAPI.java, access to wikipedia pages in French all stored in a mysql database, up to feb 2104
       For the database configuration, in a mysql database, create an user "contonmina/contnomina" in localhost, 
       Create the wikipedia database by executing the script in wikipedia/db/dbWikibackupMar32014.sql

-src/labelpropagation
	LabelPropagation.java, prepares the input for the JUNTO label propagation toolit and evaluates its output file
